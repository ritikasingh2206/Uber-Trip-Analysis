# ðŸš– Uber Trip Demand Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict **daily Uber trip counts** based on historical data, helping optimize Uberâ€™s operations by anticipating demand and improving resource allocation. Accurate trip demand forecasting supports Uber in reducing passenger wait times and better managing driver availability.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting data to the right format for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized key insights, including the distribution of trips, day-by-day trends, and correlations with active vehicles.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as day of the week, month, and rolling averages to capture patterns in trip demand.
4. **Model Building**: Tested multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict trip counts.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics; Random Forest achieved the best results with high accuracy and interpretability.

## Results
- **Random Forest** outperformed other models, capturing complex relationships in the data with a high R-squared and the lowest MSE.
- **Linear Regression** provided a simpler, interpretable baseline, ideal for initial insights.

## Key Takeaways
This project reinforced the importance of feature engineering and balancing model complexity with interpretability. It demonstrates how data-driven insights can aid urban mobility solutions by optimizing trip demand predictions.

## Next Steps
Future improvements could include integrating external data like weather and testing ensemble methods to further enhance prediction accuracy.
